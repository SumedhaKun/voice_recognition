# Voice Recognition Project

This project diarizes, transcribes, and attributes voice clips to voice owners.

## How To Use:

### 1. Enrollment:

Run enroll.py. Enter your name when prompted. When it starts recording, say a few sentences clearly (minimize any background noise) until it stops recording.

### 2. Testing:

Run main.py. When it starts recording, multiple people can talk (though not all at once). It will then process and return the result like this:

```
Person1: Hello there, this is me talking
Person2: Now it's me talking. Hello world.
Person1: Back to me. Bye.
```

### 3. Correction:

At this point, the program will ask for Y/N feedback on its assignment so that it can store voice clips for better future attribution. Answer carefully, and test again!

#### Note:

Results are not gauranteed to be accurate.
